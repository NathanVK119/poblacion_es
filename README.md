# 🏫 Poblacion Elementary School Portal

This is the source code for a **local web-based School Portal System** developed for **Poblacion Elementary School** as part of my On-the-Job Training (OJT) from February 19 to June 16, 2025. The project aimed to help the school better manage student records and teaching resources using a simple, efficient, and offline-capable system accessible via the school’s local Wi-Fi network.

---

## 📋 About the Project

The system consists of two main modules:

- **👩‍🎓 Student Registration Module**  
  Manages student information such as sections, year levels, advisers, and enrollment status. It includes search and filter functions to help staff easily find and organize student data.

- **📁 Data Management Module**  
  Acts as a local file manager for teachers to upload and access files quickly without relying on internet connectivity. This module was created to address issues with missing or disorganized files from DepEd’s online system.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🖥️ Simple, user-friendly interface designed primarily for desktop/laptop use  
- 🖧 Local hosting using XAMPP to avoid internet dependency  
- 🌐 Access via IP address within the school’s Wi-Fi network  
- 🔍 Quick search and filtering for student records  
- 📂 File upload and management optimized for local network speeds  
- ⚙️ Automated server startup using a BAT script for convenience  
- 🔒 Secure file storage and organized data handling

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Install XAMPP and start Apache and MySQL services.  
2. Place the project folder in the XAMPP `htdocs` directory.  
3. Run the provided BAT script to start the server and open the portal automatically.  
4. Connect client devices to the same Wi-Fi network.  
5. Access the system from client devices using the server’s IP address, e.g., `http://192.168.x.x/POBLACION`.

## 🧑‍💻 Development Notes

- I was the sole developer handling full-stack development and testing.  
- Role-based access control is not implemented due to time constraints.  
- The system is designed mainly for desktops/laptops; mobile responsiveness is limited.  
- AI tools were used to speed up development and improve code quality.

## 👨‍🎓 About the Developer and Project Context

This School Portal System was developed during my On-the-Job Training (OJT)/Internship before graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT). It served as my major project where I applied and enhanced my skills in web development, networking, and QA testing. Building this system gave me valuable real-world experience and allowed me to contribute meaningfully to Poblacion Elementary School’s operations.

---

## 🎯 Purpose and Motivation

The project was motivated by the need to simplify student record management and provide teachers with a reliable local file storage solution. It was designed to address specific challenges faced by the school in managing student data and educational files efficiently without relying on unstable internet connections.

## ⚠️ Limitations and Future Improvements

- Role-based access control for different user roles is not yet implemented.  
- The system is currently optimized for desktop/laptop use; mobile responsiveness is limited.  
- Future improvements may include enhanced security features, mobile-friendly design, and cloud backup integration.

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in:

- Full-stack web development (frontend and backend)  
- Database design and management  
- Local network setup and IP-based access configuration  
- Manual and automated QA testing using Cypress  
- Using AI tools to assist coding and debugging
